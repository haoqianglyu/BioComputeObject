## 2. Fill out all the required areas in the editor. Some domains is optional to fill, refer [here](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/BCO_Specification/blob/master/schemas/biocomputeobject.json) if you are not clear. Also, I also give the documents for domains in the [BCO_Domains folder](https://github.com/haoqianglyu/BioComputeObject/tree/master/BCO_Domains) on github.
